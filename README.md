# Platform Rules

This **Giist Platform Operating Rules and Procedures** document is a supplement to our published **Acceptable Use Policy** (viewable [here](https://giist.social/acceptable-use-policy/)) that every user must acknowledge and accept as a condition of service.  Changes to rules in this document do not need to be accepted by user for continued use of the platform.  However every change to the rules here will also be published by the administrator (user *giistAdmin*) in the *Giist Announcements* topic, so users are encouraged to follow those updates.

Additionally, this repository will remain public, and full change history always available, so anyone can see the current rules, what rules were effective at any point, and how they have changed over time.

Anyone with a Github account can open a Pull Request to suggest and discuss rule changes.

## Gaining Access to the Platform

There are three ways to get an account at Giist Social, all accessible from our home page:

#### Apply for a free account

Submit your account at another social network for review: if your content and interactions there are constructive and respectful (entirely at the platform administrator's discretion), we will extend you an invite to Giist Social for free.

User will be required to authenticate when accessing Giist Social with the same account that was submitted for review (using [social login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login)).

#### Get invited

Users can invite other users provided they have invites available.  Invites are earned by getting as many net likes (likes - dislikes) on their content as their current 'seniority coins' (see below).

When sending an invite, user can choose to transfer any of their available coins or invites to the new user.

#### Pay a one-time signup fee

As a last resort, if neither option above is available, user can pay $25 to gain access.  This fee is needed to:

- Slow down troll farms and bots entering the service
- Establish identity (important since not being 'vouched for' by an inviting user or vetted by the platform)
- Encourage users inviting other users, which establishes a trust graph

Users that pay for access cannot change their name or location country, it will always reflect their name and billing address in the form of payment used.

Only one account is allowed for a given form of payment (i.e. you can only use a given credit card once)

### Gift invites with invite

Users can gift some or all of their currently available invites to a new user by specifying how many invites to transfer when creating the invitation.

## Interacting with the community requires using coins

Every user gets free coins, can earn more with certain actions, and even buy more.

Each of the following actions use 1 coin unless otherwise specified; the number of coins required can change over time and will be reflected here:

- **post**: new or reply to another (1 coin per 100 characters or fraction)
- **mention**: @ mention another user that doesn't follow you, which usually notifies them (1 coin per mention)
- **video** : 1 coin per minute
- **like**: like a post
- **dislike**: dislike a post
- **repost**: share someone else's post with your followers (1 coin regardless of post or embedded video length)
- **suggest**: suggest a change to someone else's post
- **boost**: help bubble replies to the top (in the post's *Replies-All* tab)
- **message**: send message directly to another user (but free when recipient follows you)
- **flag**: flag post for violating platform rules as specified in this document
- **support**: help user out of suspension

### Free coin allocation increases with seniority

Giving user increased power and reach the longer they've been part of the community

Each day user gets free (i.e. 'seniority') coins equal to:
- 10
- plus 1 more per each week since signup

Free coins are refilled daily at the same time that user signed up.

Current coin balances are viewable any time in the website and app's 'Coin Jar'

#### Examples:

- On day 1 user gets 10 free daily coins
- After 2 weeks user gets 12 free daily coins
- After 6 months user gets 36 free daily coins
- After 2 years user gets 114 free daily coins

### Earn more coins by:
- having a reply featured that you wrote: 2 coins - get back the one used to write + 1 reward (except when replying to your own post)
- having a reply featured that you boosted : 1 coin - get back the one used to boost
- having a suggested edit accepted: 3 coins - get back the one used to suggest + 2 reward
- having a flagged user be permanently suspended (not enough support in time): 1 coin per flagged post - get back the one used to flag

### Buy coins:

User can buy 100 coins for $10, storing up to 200 at any time, but can only use as many purchased coins in a given day as earned by seniority (see above), at most doubling their impact/reach.

### Gift coins with invite

Users can gift some or all of their currently available coins to a new user by specifying how many coins to transfer when creating the invitation.

## Community Moderation

Users can flag public content, at a cost of 1 coin (like any other public action) for not being conducive to knowledge-building or for being harmful to the community, such as:

- Making abusive or grossly demeaning comments
- Making egregiously false and easily disprovable claims (misinformation)
- Spreading knowingly false claims (disinformation)
- Marketing products or services of dubious value (i.e. 'scams')
- Sending unwelcome messages after being asked to stop
- Any of the activities listed under *Admin Moderation* below

When the number of flaggings across all the user's content over the last 30 days equals or exceeds 10 times the user's seniority coins, user is placed under temporary suspension: their content is hidden from everyone and user is prevented from using any coins and therefore engaging with the community; however they can still send direct messages to their followers, which don't cost any coins (e.g. ‘hey friend I’ve been unfairly suspended please send support’); their followers in turn can ask any other user to join in supporting as well.  Supporting users, acknowledging they may be exposed to offensive content, will be able to load and review all flagged posts in question, and choose to support or not support each one in turn.  

Same number of supports received ends user's temporary suspension and resets both flag and support counts to 0.

11x seniority coins suspend again and same number of supports unsuspend again  
12x seniority coins suspend again and same number of supports unsuspend again  
... and so on, each time increasing previous threshold by 1x

After 30 days in temporary suspension, support is no longer allowed and account is suspended indefinitely without recourse; however platform reserves the right to reinstate user under exceptional circumstances (e.g. if we determine that the reasons for flagging were largely untrue)

### Examples

To suspend first time, based on different levels of seniority:
- user in platform 1 day has 10 coins, 100 flags needed
- user in platform 2 months has 18 coins, 180 flags needed
- user in platform 2 years has 114 coins, 1140 flags needed

## Post Truthfulness Moderation

When a post is flagged as misinformation or disinformation, it contributes to the community moderation of the user as detailed above, and also it starts a moderation process on the post itself as follows:

1. **After being flagged by more than 10 users AND 10% of its viewers** it stops being included in slices (but not saved post slices) and searches, and when loaded directly or in a saved post slice it displays a warning message. Post writer is sent a message informing them that:
    - post has reduced visibility and otherwise is displaying a warning
    - a 20 coin penalty has been imposed on their account (their free daily seniority coins are reduced by 20 or zeroed out if they have less than 20)
    - if they wish to contest the penalty, they must edit the post to address the claims, by doing one of these:
        - leave post as is and write a rebuttal, in the change description
        - edit post to add more evidence or sources supporting the claim
        - edit post to remove the disputed information, and explain why this happened or simply apologize, in the change description
3. **A message is sent to every user that viewed the flagged post** with the post quoted, highlighting the changes and displaying the change description, asking them to optionally respond by clicking 1 of these 3 buttons:
    1. flagged post is actually fine
    2. update, rebuttal and/or apology is adequate, post should be considered cured
    3. update, rebuttal and/or apology is NOT adequate, post is NOT cured

3. **If and when more than 20% of post viewers respond, and more than a 2/3 supermajority of them (66%) choose options 1 or 2**, the coin penalty is removed, and post visibility is restored and warning removed.

## Admin Moderation

Site administrators can unilaterally and without recourse take action upon a single occurence of the following, whether flagged by users or found via our own manual or automated procedures (e.g. AI-powered image classification)

- Media showing nudity or depicting sex acts, in public post (posts in private topics exempted)
- Child sexual abuse (CSAM) in any content (post, message or note)
- Threatening harm on anyone in post or message
- Inciting violence in post or message
- Sharing copyrighted material without authorization in public post (posts in private topics with under 1000 members exempted)
- Attempting to get around platform rules by 'gaming the system'
- Repeatedly misrepresenting another user's actions or content when flagging them

Actions taken could be any combination of the following, solely at the administrator's discretion:

- Remove the offending content
- Give user a warning
- Disallow user from using coins for any period of time
- Disallow user from logging in and using the service for any period of time
- Terminating user from service indefinitely (any purchased or earned coins or invites are forfeited)
